Used for the AICHE 2017 meeting.
Plotted mean temperature (over all parcels and all realizations) versus time/tau_0 (t/tau = 0 to 100).
The number of levels is constant at 7.
Vary tau_0 to get a varying Da for constant chemistry.
As tau_0 decreases (higher mixing rate), the mean temperature reaches a lower value due to flame extinction.
Movies were made of realizations 00001 and 00002 for case comb_02b. One ignites and one extinguishes.
The default in the above directory is for comb_02b

Case details:
Premixed flame.
Reduced ethylene mechanism.
Initialize 20% of the domain (parcels) to products of complete combustion, the other 80% of the domain is premixed reactants.
Stoichiometric mixture.

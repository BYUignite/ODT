Experimental data for Shaddix ISF Target Flame 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See case_info folder for specific information on the case setup.

"DCL" files contain height vs. centerline data. "D" files have radial data at a
specific height. For example: D023_T.txt contains temperature data at flame
height x/D = 23.  

_T = temperature and standard deviation 
_fv = soot volume fraction and rms

Note: temperature and soot volume fraction data have a slightly different set of
x/D height data points. As a result, they have separate data files. To get those
data points separately, refer to xD_T.txt for temperature points, xD_fv.txt for
soot data points, and xD.txt for a combined list.

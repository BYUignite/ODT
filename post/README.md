## Post processing files

Once a case has been run, post-processing files can be placed in this directory. There are some post-processing files for some input cases already. These will require user modification and may not work out-of-the box. As such, they should be taken as a starting point, providing examples and ideas.

The following cases are fairly well established and can be run directly to obtain output, which is stored in the `../data/caseName/post` directory once the post-processing is complete.
* channelFlow,
* pipeFlow,
* laminar_mixing_layer (simple jupyter notebook, stored here, not in data).

BUILDING ODT

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Step 1: Build yaml libraries
--------------------------------------------------
- At the command line, run "./build_yaml.sh". 

NOTES:
- You only need to do this once after downloading the ODT code. After yaml is built, you can compile ODT any number of times without rebuilding yaml.
- Make sure you have cmake 3.9 or higher installed. 
- You may have to edit the flags in build_yaml.sh. 
    - EXAMPLE: -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/local/bin/g++ is needed on a mac, but probably not on linux.
- If you have trouble building yaml on the BYU FSL, check your module loadout.
    - As of 2/6/19, loading modules "defaultenv/3" and "cmake/3.12" works. 

Step 2: Compile ODT code 
--------------------------------------------------
- At the command line, type "make -j8 MACH=MYMACH" to build and link the code. 
OR
- In Makefile, change the "MACH=" to match your system.
- At the command line, type "make" or "make -j8" to build and link the code.

NOTES: 
- The -j8 flag runs 8 parallel cores and is optional.
- The Makefile should be machine independent.
- The make.MYMACH files (like MAC, SPARK, FSL) have system-dependent options: compiler, flags, library paths. Edit the file make.MYMACH, and create your own.
    - make.MAC = MacOS system, make.SPARK = linux system, make.OMEN = Windows system, make.FSL = BYU FSL (as of 2/6/19)
- You can also run any of the following:
    - "make -j8 MACH=MYMACH depend"
    - "make -j8 MACH=MYMACH all" where all = depend, default, and documentation
    - "make -j8 MACH=MYMACH clean" to delete .o files, documentation, logs
    - "make -j8 MACH=MYMACH documentation" to build ODT documentation via doxygen
    - "make yaml" to run build_yaml.sh
